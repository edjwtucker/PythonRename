# PythonRename
PythonRename is a unit that renames all files in a directory (non-recursive) 
according to the file creation date-time, with a possible appended tag. 
This module was written to deal with the intensely annoying Android habit of 
naming photos DSC_XXXX_Y.png, thus upsetting the ordering of your photos when 
moving between device and SD Card storage.    

Usage:  PythonRename.py  DIRECTORY  TAG
